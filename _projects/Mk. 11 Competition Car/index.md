## Objective  
The electrical system required robust waterproofing, organized wire routing, and rapid manufacturability while maintaining serviceability and minimizing cost, mass, and development time. The design needed to integrate seamlessly with existing mechanical and electrical subsystems.

## Role and Responsibilities  
- Led the mechanical design of electrical enclosures and wiring layouts
- Coordinated integration between mechanical and electrical teams
- Established manufacturing and validation processes for low-volume production

## Technical Approach
- Designed a complete wire-harness layout in SolidWorks Electrical, defining relative component positioning and wire lengths to improve organization, reduce excess wiring, and lower material cost
- Developed a decision matrix in Microsoft Excel evaluating two likely waterproofing strategies based on cost, manufacturability, reliability, serviceability, and environmental resistance
- Designed waterproof enclosures to a minimum IP65 rating for functionally critical PCBs and low-voltage batteries
- Created a parametric, equation-driven assembly in SolidWorks, enabling rapid iteration across multiple vehicle configurations and reducing development time by approximately 50%
- Established a standardized, cost-effective manufacturing workflow using 3D printing and laser cutting, enabling production of required part volumes within a five-day manufacturing cycle
- Iteratively improved upon the servicability/quality of life by taking advantage of the manufacturing method and materials, implementing heat-set inserts, a dovetail O-ring sealing groove, and vibration-damping standoffs

## Verification and Validation
Designed and executed enclosure validation testing, including:
- Rain exposure testing using a custom rain-test rig
- Vibration testing to assess mechanical robustness
- Serviceability optimization ensuring enclosure open/close times under 30 seconds per maintenance cycle
- Incorporated test feedback into iterative design improvements

## Results and Outcomes
- Improved electrical system organization and integration across vehicle subsystems
- Reduced development time by 50% through parametric modeling
- Achieved repeatable, low-cost manufacturing with rapid turnaround
- Successfully validated enclosure designs against environmental and serviceability requirements

<span style="font-size: 10px">"Starship Test Flight Mission" from https://www.flickr.com/photos/spacex/52821641477/</span>  
You can put in multiple entries. All images will be at a fixed height in the same row. With smaller window, they will switch to columns.  

### Embeed images
{% include image-gallery.html images="project2.jpg" height="400" %} 
place the images in project folder/images then update the file path.   


## Embedding youtube video
The second video has the autoplay on. copy and paste the 11-digit id found in the url link. <br>
*Example* : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={**MhVw-MHGv4s**}&ab_channel=engineerguy
{% include youtube-video.html id="MhVw-MHGv4s" autoplay= "false"%}
{% include youtube-video.html id="XGC31lmdS6s" autoplay = "true" %}

you can also set up custom size by specifying the width (the aspect ratio has been set to 16/9). The default size is 560 pixels x 315 pixels.  

The width of the video below. Regardless of initial width, all the videos is responsive and will fit within the smaller screen.
{% include youtube-video.html id="tGCdLEQzde0" autoplay = "false" width= "900px" %}

## Adding a hozontal line
---

## Starting a new line
leave two spaces "  " at the end or enter <br>

## Adding bold text
this is how you input **bold text**

## Adding italic text
Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.

## Adding ordered list
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item

## Adding unordered list
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item

## Adding code block
```ruby
def hello_world
  puts "Hello, World!"
end
```

```python
def start()
  print("time to start!")
```

```javascript
let x = 1;
if (x === 1) {
  let x = 2;
  console.log(x);
}
console.log(x);

```

## Adding block quote
> A blockquote would look great if you need to highlight something


## Adding table 

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1, Col 1 | Row 1, Col 2 |
| Row 2, Col 1 | Row 2, Col 2 |

make sure to leave aline betwen the table and the header
