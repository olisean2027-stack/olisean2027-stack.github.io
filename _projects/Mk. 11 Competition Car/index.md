## Objective  
The electrical system required robust waterproofing, organized wire routing, and rapid manufacturability while maintaining serviceability and minimizing cost, mass, and development time. The design needed to integrate seamlessly with existing mechanical and electrical subsystems.

## Role and Responsibilities  
- Led the mechanical design of electrical enclosures and wiring layouts
- Coordinated integration between mechanical and electrical teams
- Established manufacturing and validation processes for low-volume production

## Technical Approach
- Designed a complete wire-harness layout in SolidWorks Electrical, defining relative component positioning and wire lengths to improve organization, reduce excess wiring, and lower material cost
- Developed a decision matrix in Microsoft Excel evaluating two likely waterproofing strategies based on cost, manufacturability, reliability, serviceability, and environmental resistance
- Designed waterproof enclosures to a minimum IP65 rating for functionally critical PCBs and low-voltage batteries
- Created a parametric, equation-driven assembly in SolidWorks, enabling rapid iteration across multiple vehicle configurations and reducing development time by approximately 50%
- Established a standardized, cost-effective manufacturing workflow using 3D printing and laser cutting, enabling production of required part volumes within a five-day manufacturing cycle
- Iteratively improved upon the servicability/quality of life by taking advantage of the manufacturing method and materials, implementing heat-set inserts, a dovetail O-ring sealing groove, and vibration-damping standoffs

## Verification and Validation
Designed and executed enclosure validation testing, including:
- Rain exposure testing using a custom rain-test rig
- Vibration testing to assess mechanical robustness
- Serviceability optimization ensuring enclosure open/close times under 30 seconds per maintenance cycle
- Incorporated test feedback into iterative design improvements

## Results and Outcomes
- Improved electrical system organization and integration across vehicle subsystems
- Reduced development time by 50% through parametric modeling
- Achieved repeatable, low-cost manufacturing with rapid turnaround
- Successfully validated enclosure designs against environmental and serviceability requirements
