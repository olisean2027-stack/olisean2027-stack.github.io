## Objective  
The electric motor and inverter required reliable thermal management under varying load conditions while maintaining electrical safety and minimizing parasitic losses. The cooling system needed to meet a target flow rate, integrate with existing vehicle hardware, and comply with safety constraints.

## Role and Responsibilities  
- Performed analytical and experimental validation of the tractive cooling system
- Developed thermal models for motor and inverter heat generation
- Designed mechanical safety features for electrical hardware integration

## Technical Approach
- Conducted head loss calculations across pumps, hoses, fittings, and heat exchangers to size components and predict system flow behavior
- Collaborated with a two-person team to experimentally validate flow rates and pressure losses, achieving the target 12 L/min system flow
- Developed a MATLAB-based thermal load analysis tool to model heat generation and rejection for the electric motor and inverter across operating conditions
- Validated thermal models empirically and used results to optimize operating parameters, enabling a 5% improvement in overall energy efficiency
- Engineered a mechanically interlocking connector system designed to enforce safety constraints and prevent improper installation of critical electrical hardware

## Verification and Validation
- Bench-tested cooling loops to correlate analytical head loss predictions with measured flow rates
- Compared MATLAB thermal model outputs against experimental temperature data to validate accuracy
- Verified mechanical safety constraints through fit, interference, and misuse-case testing

## Results and Outcomes
- Achieved required 12 L/min flow rate across a multi-component dual-loop system
- Improved system energy efficiency by 5% through validated thermal optimization
- Increased electrical safety and robustness via mechanically enforced connector constraints

You can put in multiple entries. All images will be at a fixed height in the same row. With smaller window, they will switch to columns.  

### Embeed images
{% include image-gallery.html images="image.png" height="400" %} 
place the images in project folder/images then update the file path.   


## Embedding youtube video
The second video has the autoplay on. copy and paste the 11-digit id found in the url link. <br>
*Example* : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={**MhVw-MHGv4s**}&ab_channel=engineerguy
{% include youtube-video.html id="MhVw-MHGv4s" autoplay= "false"%}
{% include youtube-video.html id="XGC31lmdS6s" autoplay = "true" %}

you can also set up custom size by specifying the width (the aspect ratio has been set to 16/9). The default size is 560 pixels x 315 pixels.  

The width of the video below. Regardless of initial width, all the videos is responsive and will fit within the smaller screen.
{% include youtube-video.html id="tGCdLEQzde0" autoplay = "false" width= "900px" %}

## Adding block quote
> A blockquote would look great if you need to highlight something


## Adding table 

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1, Col 1 | Row 1, Col 2 |
| Row 2, Col 1 | Row 2, Col 2 |

make sure to leave aline betwen the table and the header
